## Usage

1. Start by running `./setup` to install the development dependencies.
   (reason for doing this is to make sure you get the latest stable versions).
2. After this is done you you can remove the `setup` file.
3. Make sure you edit `package.json` with a new name and meta information.
4. Open `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and change `run: ./setup` to: `run: npm install`.
